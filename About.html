            <p >I came to better myself as a developer and set forth a new path that will allow me to have a
                better future.
                I truly aspire to be a great fullstack developer so that I may help future employers,
                but mainly create something that could benefit people in my community and others in other communities.

        <h1>What Have I Learned?</h1>
        <p>I found that through web development, I've had better insight on tackling large problems.
            I've learned to break large problems down into smaller sections, and then take those smaller sections and
            has out the finer details in them.
            Along with tackling large problems, I've excelled in working with groups and understanding the roles each
            person plays. It's important to understand
            that most problems or projects, whether it be at work or in life, are easier to tackle with a community to
            help.

        <h1>Vision As A Developer?</h1>
        <p>With the way tech world is moving, I do see myself getting more work experience at first so that I can get a
            full grasp of how the tech environment is.
            Once I get a good grip on it, of course I want to move forward onto making a beneficial app to help service
            other people, particularly small local business
            owners to help compete with larger chain stores. I see the world moving closer and closer to online retail,
            so I would love to help those business transition
            to more of an online presence and drive traffic their way.
